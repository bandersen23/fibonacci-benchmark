Originally published in the article [A Python Substitute? I Tried Out the Best Programming Language Youâ€™ve Never Heard Of](https://medium.com/better-programming/a-python-substitute-i-tried-out-the-best-programming-language-youve-never-heard-of-9e29cd1893c0?source=friends_link&sk=61b12cfd6456f992013ba61e710efc72).

In this experiment I compared speed of execution of a program to print the n-th Fibonacci number.

The goal was to test the speed of [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) against Python and C, with Go being added later.

## How to Run

**1. Make sure you have the "languages" installed before you try to run these programs.**

* [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
* [Get Nim](https://nim-lang.org/install.html)
* [Download GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html) (C Compiler)

**2. Compile the files that need to be compiled.**

Nim:
```
nim c fibonacci.nim
```

Go:
```
go build fibonacci.go -o fib
```

C:
```
gcc fibonacci.c
```

**3. Run and time the programs**

To time the programs I used the `time` command in Bash. The first run of each program after system startup should be discarded, and we're interested in the "real" time.

Nim:
```
time ./fibonacci
```

Go:
```
time ./fib
```

C:
```
time ./a.out
```

Python:
```
time python3 fibonacci.py
```
